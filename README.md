ðŸ¦€ Rust Programming Exercises
This repository contains beginner-level Rust programs designed to help new learners understand core programming concepts in Rust. Each program demonstrates a fundamental concept, such as variable declaration, printing output, control flow, data structures, and memory safety.

ðŸ“š List of Exercises
Basic Output

Display text using the print! macro.

Pattern Printing

Use loops and string manipulation to print a simple numeric pattern.

Variables and Mutability

Declare variables of different types.

Demonstrate mutability and value updates.

Use println! with placeholders.

Scope and Shadowing

Understand how variable scope works.

Learn how Rust handles variable shadowing in inner scopes.

Type Declarations

Show both implicit and explicit type declarations.

Array Declaration

Create an array of integers divisible by 2 from 0 to 10.

Demonstrate array initialization and printing.

Tuples

Create and access tuple values with different data types.

Array Slicing

Perform various slicing operations:

Slice of specific indices.

Omit start or end index.

Full array slice.

Constants

Declare and print different types of constants using the const keyword.

String Objects

Convert a string literal (&str) to a heap-allocated String object.
