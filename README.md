🦀 Rust Programming Exercises

Welcome to the Rust Programming Exercises repository! This collection of beginner-friendly Rust programs is designed to help new learners grasp the core concepts of Rust, such as ownership, type safety, control flow, and data structures.

Each exercise is written with clarity and purpose to build a solid foundation in Rust programming.

📚 List of Exercises
✅ Basic Output

Display simple messages using the print! and println! macros.

🔢 Pattern Printing

Use loops and string manipulation to print numeric or symbolic patterns.

🧮 Variables and Mutability

Declare variables of various types (i32, f64, etc.).

Demonstrate mutability with mut.

Use println! with placeholders for formatted output.

📦 Scope and Shadowing

Understand variable scope in blocks.

Explore shadowing — reusing variable names with different types or values.

🧾 Type Declarations

Use both implicit and explicit type annotations.

Understand when and why to use type declarations in Rust.

📚 Array Declaration

Create an array of integers divisible by 2 from 0 to 10.

Learn array initialization and iteration using for loops.

📦 Tuples

Declare tuples with mixed data types (e.g. (i32, f64, &str)).

Access and print tuple elements using dot notation.

✂️ Array Slicing

Perform different types of slicing:

Specific indices: &arr[1..4]

Omit start or end: &arr[..3], &arr[2..]

Full slice: &arr[..]

🧊 Constants

Declare constants using the const keyword.

Understand compile-time immutability and naming conventions (UPPER_CASE).

📖 String Objects

Convert string literals (&str) to String objects.

Demonstrate basic string operations like:

Concatenation

Length

Push / Pop

Cloning
